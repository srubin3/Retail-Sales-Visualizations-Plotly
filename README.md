Code Overview


This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook Sales_Analysis_Plotly.ipynb, which will generate eight interactive Plotly visualizations (and static PNG files) for retail sales data, created as part of my FullStack Academy data analytics portfolio. 
My goal was to advance my skills in crafting complex interactive visualizations, such as 3D plots and animations using the Plotly library. 
The Plotly documentation was essential for learning advanced features like subplots, hover interactions, and color scales, enabling me to build engaging and insightful visualizations. 
This project demonstrates my commitment to mastering data visualization for impactful storytelling.
